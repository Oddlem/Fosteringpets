# There's four things to do right now:

# 1. Figure out how to animate sprites
# 2. Properly implement objects, and have classes grab an image from a list rather than be hardcoded **DONE**
# 3. Find a way to implement collision in the background, maybe even by adding wall sprites
# 4. Turn some things into functions and overall make the game loop itself more clean **Always a priority!**


# Things to do after I finish these:

# 1. Figure out how to make different creature objects from the Creature class, AND animate them
# 2. Find a way to create different screens/scenes, though I have a small idea already of how to do that
# 3. Interacting with creatures, each with unique dialogue. **IN PROGRESS**
# 4. Have unique animations for each action and EACH character, like walking, idling, talking, etc.
# 5. Create a working GUI with buttons, though a mockup before this is important
